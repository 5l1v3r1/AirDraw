# AirDraw

I want to draw stuff in the air and have it appear on my phone screen as a drawing. I don't know if my watch's accelerometer is good enough for that, but I guess I'll find out soon enough.

# Results

I was unable to get this to work well. The accelerometer seems to be too unpredictable, and integrating acceleration twice to get position likely increased this error.
